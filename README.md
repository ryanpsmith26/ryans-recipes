# Ryan's Recipes

Link to latest build w/ Expo: https://expo.io/@ryanpsmith26/ryans-recipes

This is (will be) a mobile application for adding, exploring and sharing recipes with your friends and the world. The app is built with React Native for iOS and Android but has only been tested on iOS.

Currently, you can view a handful of built-in recipes as well as add your own. There is no backend for this project yet, so any recipes added will be held on state (managed with Redux) and lost at the end of the session.
